The elderly curator of the Louvre has been murdered inside the museum, his body covered in baffling symbols. As Langdon and gifted French cryptologist Sophie Neveu sort through the bizarre riddles, they are stunned to discover a trail of clues hidden in the works of Leonardo da Vinci—clues visible for all to see and yet ingeniously disguised by the painter.\r\n\r\nEven more startling, the late curator was involved in the Priory of Sion—a secret society whose members included Sir Isaac Newton, Victor Hugo, and Da Vinci—and he guarded a breathtaking historical secret. Unless Langdon and Neveu can decipher the labyrinthine puzzle—while avoiding the faceless adversary who shadows their every move—the explosive, ancient truth will be lost forever.`,\r\n  },\r\n];\r\n\r\nexport default books;\r\n","import { UserAction, IUser } from \"../../interfaces\"\r\nimport { LOAD_USER, LOG_OUT } from \"../Actions/userActions\"\r\n\r\nconst userState: IUser = {\r\n    id: 'tomas',\r\n    name: 'Tomas Sawyer',\r\n    email: 'tomas@sawyer.com'\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst userReducers = (state = userState, action: UserAction) => {\r\n    switch(action.type){\r\n        case LOAD_USER:\r\n            return action.payload;\r\n        case LOG_OUT:\r\n            return {};\r\n        default:\r\n            return state;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\nexport default userReducers;\r\n","import { combineReducers } from \"redux\";\r\nimport bookReducers from './bookReducers';\r\nimport userReducers from \"./userReducers\";\r\n\r\nexport default combineReducers({\r\n    books: bookReducers,\r\n    user: userReducers\r\n})\r\n","import {  createStore } from \"redux\";\r\nimport reducers from \"./Reducers\";\r\n\r\nexport default createStore(reducers)","import React from \"react\";\nimport ReactDOM from \"react-dom\";\nimport \"./index.css\";\nimport App from \"./App\";\nimport reportWebVitals from \"./reportWebVitals\";\nimport { Provider } from \"react-redux\";\nimport store from \"./Redux/store\";\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <Provider store={store}>\n    <App />\n  </Provider>,\n  document.getElementById(\"root\")\n);\n\n// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function\n// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))\n// or send to an analytics endpoint.
